# Exploratory-Ananlysis

In this project, I would be performing an exploratory data analysis on African food production between 2014 - 2018.  The dataset is provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

I will be answering the following questions: 

What is the total sum of Animal Fat produced in 2014 and 2017 respectively?

What is the mean and standard deviation across the whole dataset for the year 2015 to 3 decimal places? 

What is the total number and percentage of missing data in 2016 to 2 decimal places? 

Which year had the highest correlation with ‘Element Code’?

What year has the highest sum of Import Quantity? 

What is the total number of the sum of Production in 2014? 

Which of the elements had the highest sum in 2018? 

Which of the elements had the 3rd lowest sum in 2018?

What is the total Import Quantity in Algeria in 2018?

What is the total number of unique countries in the dataset?
